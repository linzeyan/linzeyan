# **About Me**

Hi I am **{{ site.author.name }}** :wave:,<br>

As a 5-year-experienced Network Operation Engineer, I am seeking a role as a Junior Backend Engineer in Golang.

I have experience using cloud services such as Aliyun, AWS, and GCP, and I am familiar with the programming languages Golang and Python with approximately two years of experience. In terms of Python, I have written crawlers and processed captchas, and I have also had some exposure to Django and Flask frameworks. With Golang, I have developed a command line tool [ops-cli](https://github.com/linzeyan/ops-cli), and I have also attempted to develop a backend management system, though it remains unfinished.
